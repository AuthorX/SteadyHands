# SteadyHands

A Hollow Knight mod that automatically updates the map when opened. Always requires one map to be bought, to enable the map screen, but (optionally) allows the map for each area to be viewed and updated as soon as it's entered, before buying it from Cornifer. Does not affect Cornifer's behavior, maps can still be bought.
